They can be difficult to repay. Payday loan amounts may be a substantial portion of a borrower’s income, according to The Pew Charitable Trusts, and their high fees and short repayment terms can make it difficult for borrowers to repay the loan and cover everyday expenses. This is how the payday loan debt cycle begins.

They’re popular, fast and easy to get. Millions of Americans use payday loans each year, according to Pew. That’s because they’re a fast cash source, and most borrowers are approved regardless of credit history or income.

Payday loan fees are high in order to cover lenders’ risk. Payday lenders don’t assess your ability to repay a loan and instead charge high fees to make up for the risk that you default.

Lenders don’t report to credit bureaus; they do report to collections. Payday lenders don’t report payments to the three major credit bureaus, so repaying a payday loan on time won't improve your chances of qualifying for a lower-rate loan later. However, unpaid payday loans are reported to collections, which can hurt your credit.
