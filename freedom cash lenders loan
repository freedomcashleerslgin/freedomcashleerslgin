High-interest installment loans are a mix between payday loans and traditional personal loans. Theyâ€™re typically offered by online lenders in amounts roughly between $1,000 and $10,000. Repayment terms are between nine months and five years, and triple-digit APRs are common.

Some high-cost installment lenders do a hard credit check before approval, while others do a soft check or no credit check.

High-cost installment loans can have biweekly or monthly payments. If the borrower is unable to pay, the lender may offer to refinance the loan to a longer term. Refinancing can make the loan's total interest costs higher than the amount originally borrowed.
